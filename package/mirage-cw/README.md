# Mirage

Mirage is a mod that gives any enemy the ability to mimic a player's voice.  This is a port of [Mirage](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/qwbarch/Mirage/) from Lethal Company.  
**Mod is required by the host and on all clients.** Clients that do not have the mod will run into desynchronization issues.

#### Note: Consider this an early release, and expect there to be bugs.

## Features

- Every enemy can mimic the voice of any player currently in the game.
- Delay between each voice mimic attempt can be configured via ``MimicMinDelay`` and ``MimicMaxDelay``.
- Configuration is synced to all other players (except for the personal preferences section).

By default, only the ``Zombe``, ``Jello``, and ``Dog`` will mimic voices.

## Can I reupload the mod to Thunderstore?

No, reuploading the mod to Thunderstore is not permitted. If you are creating a modpack, please use the official mod.  
If you're making small changes for your friends, you will need to share the compiled ``.dll`` directly with them, and then import it locally.

## Acknowledgements

- [RugbugRedfern](https://rugbug.net) - Mirage is heavily inspired by their Lethal Company mod, [Skinwalkers](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/RugbugRedfern/Skinwalkers/), and relies on [MyceliumNetworking](https://thunderstore.io/c/content-warning/p/RugbugRedfern/MyceliumNetworking/).
- [Zaggy1024](https://github.com/Zaggy1024) - For pointing me towards setting up a debug build of the game, which is required for me to be able to run a performance profiler.
